const bb = 'The sustained global economic expansion and an outlook for gradual monetary policy normalization – with inflation moving slowly back\n' +
    'toward trend in the U.S. – make for a positive backdrop for risk assets. Yet we believe equities offer a better risk-reward profile than\n' +
    'credit given their potential for greater upside in returns and more balanced downside risks. At tight levels of spreads (or high bond\n' +
    'prices), the risk profile of credit tends to be asymmetric: limited return upside, with significant potential downside. This is because the\n' +
    'return on a corporate bond held to maturity is limited to its yield, while the potential downside is much greater in the case of default.\n' +
    'Tight yield spreads on U.S. high yield bonds today reflect the current benign environment for defaults. This leaves little safety cushion\n' +
    'against risks either from rising interest rates or any increase in default risk. Bottom line: Credit has little further price upside in the case\n' +
    'of ongoing economic growth and strong equity markets, but plenty of downside risk in a growth slowdown and equity market sell-off.\n' +
    'Credit quality has also long been eroding in some pockets of the credit market, with the thirst for yield leading to a more favorable\n' +
    'environment for issuers at the expense of lenders. For example, the quality of the covenants protecting lenders has been declining for\n' +
    'some time and “add-backs” – which allow issuers to inflate some measures of earnings and thus creditworthiness – are on the rise.\n' +
    'Also, BlackRock’s proprietary market positioning gauge – which includes fund flow data and measures of price momentum – shows\n' +
    'positioning in the U.S. credit market at relatively hot levels, versus a more neutral stance in U.S. equities compared with recent history.\n' +
    'Overall, this argues for taking risk in equities over credit. Within credit, however, we prefer up-in-quality exposures and favor the U.S.\n' +
    'over Europe, where richer valuations mean lower income potential and higher sensitivity to interest rates. We expect rates to move\n' +
    'gradually higher globally, so we have an underweight stance on duration, but see long-term government bonds as useful portfolio diversifiers. ' +
